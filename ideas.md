## base capture randomness

- king has to sit in chair to claim / capture territory
- king can't perform 'sitting' action in any chair if walls surround territory
- king is completely vulnerable while sitting, can only trigger blackpowder keg
- knights can pick up king in chair
- oddity: knights yeet king in chair over territory to start claiming it
